# PONG Game

## Project Overview

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Pong game using the Turtle graphics library. The game involves two paddles and a ball, and players score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The game continues until one player reaches 7 points, at which point a winner is declared.

## Features

- **Paddle Movement**: Control paddles using keyboard keys (`Up` and `Down` arrows for the right paddle, `w` and `s` keys for the left paddle).
- **Ball Movement**: The ball moves and bounces off the walls and paddles.
- **Score Keeping**: The scoreboard keeps track of points scored by each player.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when one player reaches 7 points, displaying a winner and loser message.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (comes pre-installed with Python)
